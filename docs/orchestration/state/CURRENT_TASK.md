# Current Task

## Goal

Rebuild the Unity prototype from the consolidated `LETHE_DESIGN_00..07` docs as a fresh v1, treating the previous `Dev_Prototype_v0` as failed reference only.

## Why Now

Jaewoo rejected the previous Unity prototype as a trustworthy evaluation target. The issues were not just tuning: sprite framing, memory behavior, orbit/echo interpretation, and overall game-shell feel had drifted away from the design. Patching v0 risks carrying those assumptions forward.

The current source of truth is:

```

## Main Target

```text
LETHE/Assets/_dev/Scenes/Dev_Prototype_v1.unity
LETHE/Assets/_dev/Scripts/PrototypeV1/
```

Reference only:

```text
LETHE/Assets/_dev/Scenes/Dev_Prototype_v0.unity
LETHE/Assets/_dev/Scenes/Dev_EchoSlice.unity
```

## Done Criteria For This Work Unit

- Fresh v1 scene exists under `_dev`.
- Fresh v1 runtime code is isolated under `Scripts/PrototypeV1`.
- Player, camera, arena, dual blades, enemy spawn, XP/level-up, HUD, highest-level forgetting, echo cap, resonance, and Blood Blade Storm debug path exist.
- Unity compile error 0.
- Play Mode smoke creates player and enemies with no v1 runtime console exceptions.
- v1 screenshot/capture confirms player/enemy sheets are not rendered as whole sheets.

## Latest v1 Reset

- Added `V1GameManager` and `V1SceneBuilder`.
- Added `Assets/_dev/Scenes/Dev_Prototype_v1.unity`.
- v1 starts with only `Main Camera` and `V1_GameManager`; runtime creates arena/player/weapon/enemies.
- Fixed Unity Input System-only exception by supporting `Keyboard.current` with legacy fallback.
- Fixed whole-sheet rendering by cropping the generated 8x4 player/enemy sheets at runtime.

## Verification

- `dotnet build LETHE/Assembly-CSharp.csproj --nologo`: passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `unity_get_compilation_errors(port=7890, severity="all")`: `count=0`.
- `unity_scene_open(path="Assets/_dev/Scenes/Dev_Prototype_v1.unity")`: success.
- hierarchy: `V1_GameManager` has `V1GameManager`, `Main Camera` has `Camera` + `AudioListener`.
- Play Mode smoke: `player=True`, `enemies=2`, `renderers=107`, `playing=True`, `paused=False`.
- Console after Input System fix: no v1 runtime exception.
- Game capture: sprite sheets are cropped to single character/enemy frames.
- Scene saved: `sceneDirty=false`.

## Next Implementation

1. Make the v1 M1 shell feel like a game: camera scale, enemy pressure, weapon interaction, XP pacing, HUD readability.
2. Add debug smoke injection for level-up, forced forget, echo +5, Blood Blade Storm, and Gatekeeper.
3. Implement M2 Gatekeeper -> forgetting result -> deficit survival -> resonance loop.

## Open Questions

- Is v1 camera/framing acceptable as the new baseline?
- Is the M1 shell game-like enough to continue to M2?
- Should generated sheets be sliced/imported properly next, instead of runtime-cropped in the manager?

## Do Not Touch

Do not continue polishing `Dev_EchoSlice` or `Dev_Prototype_v0` as the main path. Do not add shop, meta progression, multi-region structure, or final boss.
